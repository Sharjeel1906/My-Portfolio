Sharjeel | Developer Portfolio
This is my personal developer portfolio website, built to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements as a software engineering student and aspiring developer. The website serves as an online resume, highlighting my work in Python, C++, web automation, backend development, and UI design while also providing visitors with an easy way to connect with me.

The portfolio is designed with modern UI/UX principles, a responsive layout that works on all devices, and interactive features such as a contact form with automated Google Form submission and a live visitor counter to track engagement.
